## The Neko Adventure

A simple game of me where you are a silly cat destroying things

Written in java

To run the programm:

clone the directory with git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zebakayame/Neko_Adventure.git
```

And for running, run App.java with java 21

# Understanding the version format

Basically it's like this
```Major.Minor.release.build```

The Major is when the version goes public with an official annoucement

The Minor are when we fix things or add "kind of" big things to Major but it's still pretty not a lot

The realease is whenever we hit a milestone

The build is when we are building the realease
